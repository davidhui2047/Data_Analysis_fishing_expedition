# Data_Analysis_fishing_expedition
There is a vast difference between each fishing expedition; the quantity and quality of catches will determine whether a trip is successful. Therefore, this report would like to explore what factors are related to a successful fishing venture. This report primarily based on data on the amount of fish caught by each of the 151 fishing boats working in Tasmania. For each boat, the amount of fish caught was recorded. Moreover, the total time spent on trips and the total price paid for catches was measured, along with four other factors (experienced, age of the boat, equipment and search).
