# Factors related to being successful in fishing
<b>Aim:</b> <br> This project will analyse the comparison of means between different variables; an estimation of differences in performance parameters will be calculated.
<br>This analysis will result in a comparison of catch value between the skippers and the correlation of the difference in categorical factors.
<br><br>
<b>Background:</b> <br> There is a vast difference between each fishing expedition; the quantity and quality of catches will determine whether a trip is successful. Therefore, this report would like to explore what factors are related to a successful fishing venture. This report primarily based on data on the amount of fish caught by each of the 151 fishing boats working in Tasmania. For each boat, the amount of fish caught was recorded. Moreover, the total time spent on trips and the total price paid for catches was measured, along with four other factors (experienced, age of the boat, equipment and search).
<br><br>
<b>Findings:</b> <br> <b>1.</b> The mean value paid for catches of experienced skippers was $10,800 - $20,800 higher than the mean value paid for catches of inexperienced skippers (Table 1). 
<br><b>2.</b> The mean time on spent trips for skippers with adequate search equipment was 39.2 
hours - 50.9 hours more than the mean time spent on trips for skippers with sophisticated 
search equipment (Table 2).
<br><b>3.</b> The mean time on spent trips for inexperienced skippers with average general equipment was 19.8 hours - 45.7 hours more than the mean time on spent trips for inexperienced skippers with above-average general equipment (Table 3).
<br><b>4.</b> The mean time spent on trips for experienced skippers with average general equipment 
was 11.3 hours – 32.5 hours more than the mean time on spent trips for experienced 
skippers with above-average general equipment (Table 4).
<br><b>5.</b> The mean time spent on trips for experienced skippers with average general equipment 
was 11.3 hours – 32.5 hours more than the mean time on spent trips for experienced 
skippers with above-average general equipment (Table 4).
<br><b>6.</b> The mean time spent on trips for experienced skippers with average general equipment 
was 11.3 hours – 32.5 hours more than the mean time on spent trips for experienced 
skippers with above-average general equipment (Table 4).
